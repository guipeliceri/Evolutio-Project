## üí° About the Project

The field of Data Science is one of the most exciting and sought-after areas in tech today. Everyone wants in, but the path to entry can seem daunting. We often hear about the extensive list of prerequisites: advanced Python, SQL, differential and integral calculus, statistics, probability, linear algebra...

I'm not here to say this knowledge isn't necessary‚Äîit's absolutely essential for becoming an expert.

But what if we could learn and apply these concepts in a simpler, more engaging way? **That's where Evolutio comes in!**

The goal of this project is to provide a launchpad for your journey into AI. We'll break down real-world projects, explaining every detail of the code, covering not just the programming implementation but also the mathematical logic behind it. And, of course, we'll do it all in a clear, straightforward, and lighthearted manner!

Each folder in this repository represents an AI project or concept, containing an interactive notebook (`.ipynb`) that you can run directly in your browser using Google Colab. You will find:

* **Theoretical Explanations:** A solid conceptual foundation to understand the *why* behind the code.
* **Heavily Commented Code:** Line-by-line explanations of what each part of the code does.
* **Step-by-Step Execution:** Code cells that you can run to see the magic happen in real time.

## üéØ Who is This Project For?

This repository is designed for:

* **Students** who are beginning their AI journey and want to see theory put into practice.
* **Developers** from other fields looking to transition into or understand the fundamentals of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
* **Enthusiasts and the Curious** who want to demystify what a neural network, a classification model, or any other AI concept really is.
* **Teachers and Educators** looking for practical support materials for their classes.

You don't need to be an expert. A basic understanding of programming logic and a strong desire to learn are all you need to get started!

## üöÄ How to Use This Repository

### The Easy Way: Google Colab

The best part? For most projects, it's incredibly easy to get started. You don't need to install ANYTHING on your local machine!

1.  Browse the **Project Index** below.
2.  Choose a topic that interests you.
3.  Click the **"Open in Colab"** button ‚ú®.
4.  The notebook will open in the Google Colab environment. Follow the instructions, run the code cells, and have fun learning!

### For Heavier Projects: Visual Studio Code

Some advanced AI projects, especially those involving large datasets or intensive training, may exceed the memory or time limits of Google Colab's free version. For these specific cases:

* We will use **Visual Studio Code** for local development.
* Instructions will be provided within the project's specific folder, guiding you on how to clone the repository, set up a local Python environment, and install the necessary libraries.
* This approach introduces you to a professional development workflow, a crucial skill in the data science field.

## üì¨ About Me

Hi there! My name is Guilherme Peliceri. I'm 20 years old, born in S√£o Jos√© do Rio Preto - S√£o Paulo, and I'm currently studying Systems Analysis and Development at Unicamp (the best university in Brazil!).

My dream is to work on the creation and development of Artificial Intelligence. I decided to create this project for my own personal growth in the data field and because I know many others share this same passion. My goal is to create a starting point for anyone who wants to embark on this journey.

Let's learn together!
